# How to Interpret Charts

## ADL and MFV

The Accumulation Distribution Line is a cumulative measure of each period's volume flow, or money flow.
    * High positive multiplier combined with high volume shows strong buying pressure.
    * A low negative number combined with high volume reflects strong selling pressure.
    * Money Flow Volume (MFV) accumulates to form a line that either confirms or contradicts the underlying price trend.
        * used to either reinforce the underlying trend or cast doubts on its sustainability.
    * An uptrend in prices with a downtrend in the Accumulation Distribution Line suggests underlying selling pressure.
    * A downtrend in prices with an uptrend in the Accumulation Distribution Line indicate underlying buying pressure.

In essence, if the ADL and MFV is going up while the stock price is going down, buy.  If the ADL and MFV is going down while the stock price is going up, sell.
